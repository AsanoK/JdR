Myrmidon Assault Gun

The Myrmidon is a popular alternative to the Leman Russ in many PDF units, and is also often seen in service to the forces of the Archenemy. The vehicle is a squat, boxy thing with a Battle Cannon mounted in the front of its well armored hull. Due to the fact that it does not have a turret, the vehicle is only 1/3 of the cost of a Leman Russ, and easier to maintain. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost. The cannon, obviously, can only fire towards the front of the vehicle. The vehicle's only other weapon is a pintle mounted stubber; it is extremely vulnerable to ambush or while being used in urban terrain.
