Core system:
dice pools (d10) above a threshold (basic success score is 8+, modified by advantage/disadvantage)
opposed checks are simply to opposed basic checks
teamwork adds the successes from supporting character(s) to the pool of the active character

Core skills are used as basis for the dice pools
If a specialty fits the situation, the character may get a number of bonus dices to their pool
advantage and disadvantage change the threshold to get success on dices.
Masteries may give a bonus to the dice pool as well.
