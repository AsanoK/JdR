Scavenger Scarab:
Giant scarab feeding off carrions and rotting plant matter. They will not hesitate to add some preys to their diet by themselves if necessary, but if they are busy, they can also ignore creatures going by.
They don't fly, but can, and will, expell stings toward their targets. These are thankfully not poisoned, but can be lethal nonetheless.
