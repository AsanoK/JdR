Boss
Goliath insect
These creatures lives deep in the forest, where they mostly eat rotting matter, be it flesh or plants. But when their territory is threatened, they can turn into a terrific foe, smashing everything under they armored wrath. They are deeply feared by any forest Haven, and are a prime target for hunting parties seeking to keep them safe.
There can also represent a surprising bounty, both for their shell, that provides a light but resilient armor, and for some of their organs, which can be used in some rituals and potions. Their main horn can be used to craft blades.
Males are often alone and are the most encountered, while herds of females and youngs gather in the deep woods.

Fire Wyrm
The fire wyrm is now endemic of the cinderlands, ravaging what's left of the old imperial structures. Their fly is silent, to approach their targets, before unleashing their firepower at close range. They can spit flames up to a few meters, and tear things down with their claws to finish the job.
They notoriously favour the taste of burned flesh over anything else, and some packs may be bold enough to attack havens on a regular basis. Packs are family-based, with only a few members of each generation leaving the group.
