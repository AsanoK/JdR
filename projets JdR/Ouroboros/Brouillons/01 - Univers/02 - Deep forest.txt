It has sprouted from the ashes of the cataclysm, around an old forest on the border of the old empire. It would probably take weeks, or even months to cross, assuming one would be able to.
Its mood varies from place to place, but goes darker as one goes deeper into it. Some islands of light exists inside, but they are fewer and fewer as one goes nearer the heart of the forest.
Creatures inside are not necessary corrupted, but their growth is extraordinary, and many are threats to any party trying to explore the region.
The deeper you go, the stranger and the bigger the creatures are, as if one was entering marine abyss. Not everything is a threat, but one must be ever careful when marching through this lands.
They are few Havens under the canopy, and all but one are in the lighter portions of the forest, so as not to be found unexpectedly by one of the leviathan that lurks in the shadows of the trees.
The lighter parts are extremely colorful and full of life, with the ever-present sound of birds and numerous critters, most being completely unafraid of men. Colors are bright, from flowers to feathers, and one may even see a bit of blue sky in some places.
The intermediate forest, in contrast, feels empty, almost barren, compared to the lighter parts. Animals are few and fearful, or are errand creatures, looking for their next meal. The tree there are already of a size unseen out of this region. 
In the deep forest, it is actually impossible to discern day from night, and life is only found in some specific spot : maybe an old leviathan died there and scavengers are feasting, or some river runs there, and provides water to the creatures of the region. Light is extremely scarce, and one should be wary of it, as some creatures of the deep hunt by baiting their preys through luminescence.
