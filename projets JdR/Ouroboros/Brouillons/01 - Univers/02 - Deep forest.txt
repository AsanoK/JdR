It has sprouted from the ashes of the cataclysm, around an old forest on the border of the old empire.
Its mood varies from place to place, but goes darker as one goes deeper into it. Some islands of light exists inside, but they are fewer and fewer as one goes nearer the heart of the forest.
Creatures inside are not necessary corrupted, but their growth were already unchecked by the knights of old, and may now be fully out of proportions.
The deeper you go, the stranger and the bigger the creatures are, as if one was entering marine abyss. Not everything is a threat, but one must be ever careful when marching through this lands.
They are few Havens under the canopy, and all but one are in the lighter portions of the forest, so as not to be found unexpectedly by one of the leviathan that lurks in the shadows of the trees.
