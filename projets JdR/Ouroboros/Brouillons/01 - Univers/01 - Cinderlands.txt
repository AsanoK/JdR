Generalities
Cinderlands once were the heart of the old empire, that was completely broken by the cataclysm, that seemed to hit the cities and strongholds of this region with more intensity than others.
Now the whole region is covered in a thick layer of ashes from the great fires that ravaged the country, with just remnants of old monuments sticking out.
The old imperial road is the main way of communication, but it is far from safe to travel. Pilgrims of the Bells are traveling along this axis, trying to reach their Sacred Milestones to receive visions. It would be a grave mistake to think a busy road is safe however, for creatures are not afraid to come and hunt the pilgrims.
The husks of imperial cities now lie corrupted beyond all redemption, but they may still hold artifacts of old, as well as forgotten secrets from the imperial age. That explains why some adventurers brave the perils of these lands to try and uncover it, despite what lurks within the ruins. 
Creatures are told to roam the old ruins, most of them being horribly deformed by the Corruption.  The only place that is known for sure is the eternal city of Caridia, at the end of the imperial road. But it is problably one of the most dangerous place on the continent: corruption lies deep inside the ruins, and the abominations one can find are as disturbing to the mind as they are dangerous.
There are rumours of communities of scavengers, living from banditry and the looting of the former cities. All sorts of stories can be heard on the imperial road about hem : from ritualistic corruption, to cannibalism and horrible deals with creatures from Beyond the Veil.
