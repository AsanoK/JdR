Cataclysm - death of a world
The cataclysm is the birth of Corruption, the point in time when it entered reality and deformed bodies and minds, when it brought the unbound wrath of nature against the old Ceridian empire.
This arrival manifested differently depending on the region, from a long decline to a sudden and brutal death. Caridia the Eternal was doomed, for the corruption seemed the strongest there, and its influence brought madness, mutations, and death to its inhabitants.The very soil and water are deeply toxic there, and mundane creatures were turned into deadly dangers, haunting the now empty monuments to the glory of the emperors of old.
Most died from the cataclysm, from hunger, due to the trading routes stopping to function, from thirst, due to the corruption of drinkable water, from plagues, or from violence. This last one could come from other humans, lashing at each others over the last remnants of the Empire, or from the corrupted creatures, bigger than anything encountered and displaying strange new abilities.
The ancient knightly orders were once created to fight this threat, but most were killed in the first days of the cataclysm, trying to fight the onslaught or from treason. For some people, it was their own hubris that brought the creatures to strike back, and they killed the knights to appease the great beasts. Others were corrupted themselves, and are a dangerous threat to anything in their path. Some are still true to their oaths, even in death, even if the original meaning or community to protect is long gone.
Humanity clings to any shelter to survive, and communities have been created in Havens. Some are only inhabited by a single soul, others shelter thousands. Some have adapted to the beasts and the new situation, others still organize along the old imperial society and its cast system.

Secrets of the world
-How and why did the cataclysm happened ?
-What is the corruption, what is its cause ?
-What are the witches/another faction hiding ?
-What is the secret of such Haven ?

Cannon story:
-Cataclysm was brought when imperial scholars opened a series of long forgotten seals, scattered across the lands (some might imagine the Empire was founded to find them).
-Once characters have found the existence of one, they may choose to close it, which may then bring them on the path of finding and closing the others.
-Various characters will not agree with this, as they saw this as their own Grand Design, and fail to see that it was doomed from the very beginning. They still believe it may be saved, a century after their mistake.
-These seals are linked to the Abyss, which extends its influence around them.
Necessary bosses for such a campaign:
-fallen Grand Scholar
-guardian(s) of the seal, both former knights and shackled creatures
-Lord of the Wyrms
-corrupted emperor
-spawn of the abyss
-heart of the abyss

Public story
The old empire
The Aldarian empire once ruled over most of the continent, the most important state in the world. Its legions guarded the borders against incursions, counting on heavily fortified keeps and an effective administration system. 
Its knights orders were gathering informations about the dangerous creatures that roamed the earth, and more importantly, they were hunting them to protect the cities and villages.
Its shcolars could devise about the last advances in technologies and magic with their peers, in one of the many universities, or the Imperial College, in the capital Aldaria.
Almost none of these survived the cataclysm : the order that was brought by the imperial might was shattered instantly, and most of the organisations have disbanded when their siege of power was destroyed : knights still exist, but they are alone, and they do not have access to the archives of old. The legions were fragmented, without lead, and most became warlords, or were simply destroyed in the following wars and the ravages of the creatures.
The Cataclysm
No one knows why it happened, or what exactly was the Cataclysm, but in one single night, it shattered the old empire, destroying its capital. The corruption appeared around this time, changing the minds and bodies of those afflicted, turning them into monsters. 
The lands of the empire were once protected from creatures by the knights orders, but as they were dispersed, they grew back as a main threat, unopposed. The worst is that these creatures are not immune to corruption, and may be turned into proper abominations this way.
The core of the empire was completely destroyed by the Cataclysm, and every province was left to itself, turning quickly into chaos. 
With time, mankind was forced to retreat to safe Havens, few and far between. A Haven can be as simple as a hidden hut in the mountains, or as ambitious as a heavily fortified city, remembering sourly the time of the Empire and its richness.
