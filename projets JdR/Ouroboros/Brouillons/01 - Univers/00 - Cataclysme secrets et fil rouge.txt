Cataclysm - death of a world
The cataclysm is the birth of Corruption, the point in time when it entered reality and deformed bodies and minds, when it brought the unbound wrath of nature against the old Ceridian empire.
This arrival manifested differently depending on the region, from a long decline to a sudden and brutal death. Caridia the Eternal was doomed, for the corruption seemed the strongest there, and its influence brought madness, mutations, and death to its inhabitants.The very soil and water are deeply toxic there, and mundane creatures were turned into deadly dangers, haunting the now empty monuments to the glory of the emperors of old.
Most died from the cataclysm, from hunger, due to the trading routes stopping to function, from thirst, due to the corruption of drinkable water, from plagues, or from violence. This last one could come from other humans, lashing at each others over the last remnants of the Empire, or from the corrupted creatures, bigger than anything encountered and displaying strange new abilities.
The ancient knightly orders were once created to fight this threat, but most were killed in the first days of the cataclysm, trying to fight the onslaught or from treason. For some people, it was their own hubris that brought the creatures to strike back, and they killed the knights to appease the great beasts. Others were corrupted themselves, and are a dangerous threat to anything in their path. Some are still true to their oaths, even in death, even if the original meaning or community to protect is long gone.
Humanity clings to any shelter to survive, and communities have been created in Havens. Some are only inhabited by a single soul, others shelter thousands. Some have adapted to the beasts and the new situation, others still organize along the old imperial society and its cast system.

Cannon story:
-Cataclysm was brought when imperial scholars opened a series of long forgotten seals, scattered across the lands (some might imagine the Empire was founded to find them).
-Once characters have found the existence of one, they may choose to close it, which may then bring them on the path of finding and closing the others.
-Various characters will not agree with this, as they saw this as their own Grand Design, and fail to see that it was doomed from the very beginning. They still believe it may be saved, a century after their mistake.
-These seals are linked to the Abyss, which extends its influence around them.
Necessary bosses for such a campaign:
-fallen Grand Scholar
-guardian(s) of the seal, both former knights and shackled creatures
-Lord of the Wyrms
-corrupted emperor
-spawn of the abyss
